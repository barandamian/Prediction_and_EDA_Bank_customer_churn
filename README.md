**Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Churn Prediction: Bank customer churn**

In this analysis, we explore the "Bank customer churn" dataset to understand the factors influencing customers' decisions to leave a bank.In addition to exploring the dataset, we develope predictive models to forecast customer churn.

**Objective**

The dataset contains various variables, each potentially impacting customer churn differently.Acquiring new clients is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, it's crucial for banks to comprehend the drivers of customer churn. By identifying and preventing churn, banks can implement loyalty programs and retention campaigns to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.
